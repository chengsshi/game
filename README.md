The evolutionary game theory aims to simulate different decision strategies in populations of individuals and to determine how the population evolves. Compared to strategies between two agents, such as cooperation or noncooperation, strategies on multiple agents are rather challenging and difficult to be simulated via traditional methods. Particularly, in a knowledge spillover problem (KSP), cooperation strategies among more than hundreds of individuals need to be simulated. At the same time, the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm, which is a data-driven and model-driven hybrid paradigm, has the potential to simulate the complex behaviors in a group of simple individuals. In this paper, a modified BSO algorithm has been used to solve KSP from the perspective of evolutionary game theory. Knowledge spillover (KS) is the sharing or exchanging of knowledge resources among individuals. Firstly, the KS and evolutionary game theory were introduced. Then, the KS model and KS optimization problems were built from the evolutionary game perspective. Lastly, the modified BSO algorithms were utilized to solve KS optimization problems. Based on the applications of BSO algorithms for KSP, the properties of different swarm optimization algorithms can be understood better. More efficient algorithms could be designed to solve different real-world evolutionary game problems.
